# The Gilded Ring
#sorcery #faction

The Gilded Ring is an order of sorcerers devoted to the study and protection of the secrets of [[Sorcery]]. Founded to act as the inner circle of [[Ramtha]], it has held many roles throughout the ages, from secret police to cloistered academicians to mercenary artificers - and often some combination of the three. 

The Ring proper is majority composed of [[Saurganite]]s, which brings it no small amount of suspicion from the wider world. Despite this, many foreign sorcerors and scholars are invited to study and work in the [[Chalaza]]. The worldwide practice of Sorcery is as such still heavily dictated by the advancements and styles of The Ring.

## Variations
 - When Ramtha is personally overseeing The Gilded Ring, it is aggressively bent towards her interests. Saurganites scour the world for knowledge and power, and seek out the enemies of Ramtha. Foreign scholars are of ill repute, and selected from malcontents of enemy nations. The general attitude is ambition, secrecy, and aloofness.
 - When Ramtha is absent, The Gilded Ring takes a more passive and cooperative approach. While still advancing their own interests, The Ring works with nations and prominent sorcerors. When sorcery is being misused, they take on a regulatory role, tracking instances of malignant sorcery to silence or correct. While they often keep to themselves, The Ring has been roused to action in extremely dire times, utilizing their vast armories of magical implements and reserves of skilled Sorcerors to oversee vast territories and lead armys.
