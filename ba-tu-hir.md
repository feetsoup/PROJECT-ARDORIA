Amongst the [[Gods]] of Ardoria, Ba-Tu-Hir is the god of industry and craft. He made the [[Sindhe]], or Ash Fae as helpers in his forge before they were made obsolete by the [[Automatons]]. His workshops were found underneath [[Mount Fest]], though no one knows where he went after the destruction of the Old World.
