No magic is more reviled or feared than Vampirism. With this High Thaumaturgy, a thaumaturge captures the Ess of a dying creature and grafts it to their own, vastly expanding their capacity for thaumaturgy at terrible cost to their spiritual and mental integrity. An affront to the natural order, most mortals recognize the abhorrence of such an act inherently.

## Costs and Benefits
The costs of Vampirism are great. Even the most sophisticated of Ess grafting changes one deeply, each addition the thaumaturge makes causing them to slide further towards an incoherence and neurosis. Working so directly with Divine Light gives one an acute sense for it, as well as a terrifying hunger. Vampirists hunt one another ruthlessly, seeking to loot one another of their stolen hordes of Ess.

The cost, to some, is trivial compared to a power beyond conception. Many of the most powerful magic-wielders to ever exist owe their power in whole or part to Vampirism. 

## Societal Views
No group claims to be the first to practice Vampirism, although academicians generally understand it to be the [[Alaktu]]. Only the most depraved, desperate, or delusional seek to learn this art, and thus join the battle for survival. Vampirists exist in small pockets wherever corruption or disorder allows them to. Many of them live in the [[Scarred Plains]], or will visit there once in their lives.

An interesting story in defiance of this can be seen in the myths of many peoples. The tale commonly speaks of a warrior or warriors of a land threatened by a foreign foe. This warrior/group takes part in Vampirism, but resist its' temptations, thus exonerating their sin. The tale ends with them swearing to never leave the foreign land, or ending their lives in some fasion. The [[Order of the Demon Hunters]] are thought to be the living embodiment of this tale - and perhaps even the inspiration for it.
