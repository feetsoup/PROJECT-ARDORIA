# Blacktongue
#sorcery #magic #language

Blacktongue is thought to be the first spoken language, developed by [[Votraak]] as a novel means of transfering information to his creation, [[Ramtha]]. Among mortals, it is rarely spoken outside of ritualistic contexts, or when working [[Sorcery]].

Blacktongue is magic given structure, and as such capable of inviting change on the world merely by its use. When the many nuances in pronunciation and interpretation are mastered, a mere utterance can outmatch even the most considered of the other [[Magic]]s. One must choose their words carefully, however, as the smallest lapse in grammar can cause unpredictable and unwanted effects.

The written form of this language borrows its letters from the [[Nekalsaid]] script.
