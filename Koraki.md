# Koraki
*(cur-ah-KEE)*
#race

Borne aloft by wings with oily feathers as black as their dream goddess' twilight embrace, the Koraki were a race of (barely) intelligent avians known for their pride and unslakable thirst for knowledge. Physically and mentally weak but masters of the occult, they enjoy and often brag about their (some may say undeserved) status as a chosen race. 

The leader of their kind was Hekacles the Starbearer, a mighty warrior and even mightier sorceror. With a wingspan of nearly twenty five feet and armed with gleaming talons forged from starmetal, he was a terror to behold, let alone aggrieve.



## RELIGION

The Koraki worship the goddess of dreams, Quemyrrha (kway-MEER-ah), who led the Koraki through the void in their sleep and thus brought them into being. She was said to be the absolute master of the esoteric and the byzantine, her labyrinthine intellect far too concerned with the mysteries of existence to bother with worldly affairs. Although unable to interact with the Gi - the Korakan word for the world - she resigned herself to an eternal slumber so that she may aid her chosen through the medium of dreams. Although their memories of her were shattered, they honor her with a silent devotion and reverence, seeing her not as a symbol of worship but as a caring sovereign and ideal to strive for.

 The Koraki maintain no organizations easily identified as religious. Their communities had no places of worship, and lack religious figures. However, beautiful towers made of gossamer stand in the hidden or empty places of the world, and in these towers live hermits named the Akroatis, who parse the messages of Quemyrrha through the cryptic, such as the petals of flowers (plants associated with her and commonly thought to be an expression of her dreams) and the position of the stars (which lie in the void, where they believe the spirit realm to be).


BLESSINGS


-Blessing of Flight - the Koraki had been gifted with powerful wings with which they make the sky their domain. This affords them a great deal of maneuverability, speed, and stealth, their forms but a flicker in the night sky.
-Blessing of Nuhm - Nuhm, a word roughly translating to ‘the spiritual existence’, was what the Koraki believe to be the source of their arcane strengths. They were deeply in tune with both the natural and spiritual realms, and were partially astral in substance, as if body and soul were one. Among other things, this means they can feed off of magical energies.




CURSES


-Curse of Weakness - The Koraki were physically and, in the traditional sense, mentally weak, lacking the facilities to build great infrastructure or develop advanced technology.
-Curse of Covetousness - Whether it be knowledge or treasure, the Koraki wish greatly to own, and consider their right to own superior to the other races.


LEGENDS

-Legend of Mayros - In their dreams, the Koraki learn the supreme art of Mayros - a form of sorcery developed by the Dreaming Monarch herself. This magic was used in nearly every facet of life, from shaping their homes from the trees to bombarding their enemies with eldritch fire from afar. Although developed by Quemyrrha, ancient scholars correctly attribute the Kokari’s use of the art to an unnamed white-winged sage who fed his soul to the void to imprint the art upon Gi.
-Legend of Pantodynamia - A ritual passed down from Quemyrrha to Hekacles, and ostensibly from Hekacles to his successor, the Pantodynamia leaves a burning mark upon the caster’s head, granting them vision beyond mere mortals. While the sovereign was no longer capable of stealth, they can see everything around them in every direction, with their vision getting hazier as the distance grows. They can make out individual hairs from up to half a mile away, distinguish between individual people and objects up to five miles away, and had a general sense of the goings ons of everything up to twenty miles away. It was said that this vision was the only thing that has protected the throne from conspirators.
-Legend of Iphedria - Unlike most figures of Koraki legend, Iphedria was a master of neither trickery nor the occult. She was an avian of immense compassion, a twinkling star of mercy among a treacherous race. When a dream had come to her of a world ruled not just by Koraki, but all winged creatures, it was by her claw alone that peace was achieved among the wandering birds and winged terrors of her forests. Although her soul now rests with the Dreaming Queen, the sons and daughters of ravenkind have not forgotten the position she secured for them in Koraki society, and now work as spies, envoys, and servants to the Archons. Other avians, such as the giant owls that were often found in Koraki forests, also hold some measure of respect for Quemyrrha’s children, and were more often than not willing to work with them.
