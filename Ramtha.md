# Ramtha
#figure #sorcery

Known more commonly among mortals as The Midnight Sorceress, Ramtha was created by [[Votraak]] in the earliest times of Ardoria. Ramtha is responsible for many major events in the land's history, including the construction of the [[Chalaza]], discovery of the [[Dradi]], the creation of the [[Koraki]], the refinement of [[Sorcery]] and [[Blacktongue]], the founding (and for most periods, leading) of [[The Gilded Ring]], and bringing about the [[Cataclysm]]. None have witnessed or had a hand in more history than her.
