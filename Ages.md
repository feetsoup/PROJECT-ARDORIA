# Ages
#concept #wip #otc

Many attempts have been made over the centuries to decipher and organize the history of Ardoria in all corners of the world. Seldom are these histories consistent between each other, whether due to false information, intentional deception, or merely a difference in perspective. There is one concept that a perceptive scholar will see emerge in some form in any people’s recounting of antiquity - the measurement known as the Age.

The timeline presented herein is a collaboration of accounts by elder beings and the recorded chronicles of as many peoples as could be studied. The names used for the Ages are strictly descriptive - contemporary names, along with their source, are included for reference. Events listed are chosen in accordance with their importance in relation to the development of the Ages.

## PRIMORDIAL AGE
*The Long Tuning* 

The Primordial Age, despite being among the most discussed in theological circles, is perhaps the most overlooked by men of quill and paper. Unfortunately, this is to be expected - the end of this era was heralded by the arrival of the Gods and creation of the first Ardorians. Even if there had been people around to make note of these times, the other problem presents itself - this Age, which lasted anywhere from a ‘mere’ few centuries to an immeasurable amount of time, is characterized by its lack of anything of note.

It is quite difficult for one mainly acquainted with Ardoria’s active period to picture the world at this point. In any given place at any given point in time, the world was cold, dark, and grey. The land was an endless, flat plain of ashlike dust, no breeze to molest its’ stillness. The horizon and the sky blurred together, as Votraak had not yet brought the night, nor Al-Arak the day. Tracking the passage of time was all but impossible, as the sun and moon had yet to be set in motion. If one were to attempt to navigate this place, they would quickly find themselves wandering in circles, no point of reference to guide themselves by, as even their footfalls were swallowed by an unseen force of obfuscation. Untouched by divine agitation, the elements lay in perfect harmonious stagnation - heat, light, sound, color, et al. lay in perfect uniformity, spread thin over the whole plane.

Even in this time of emptiness, it is curious to see that life, in its indefatigable nature, seemed to emerge. The eldest of the god’s creations speak of glimpses caught in dreams - those produced by the longest of slumbers - of strange organisms composed of interweaving chains of a gossamer like substance, lighter than a man and larger than a leviathan . Accounts of these organisms are sparse and inconsistent, and as such will be left to works that discuss their nature in greater detail.

## MYTHICAL AGE
*The First Movement, The Age of Creation*

The arrival of the Gods, the shaping of the land, the creation of the first mortals, the birth of civilization, the dawn of recorded history - No matter what event one considers the start of the Mythical Age, they could quite comfortably argue that it was one of the most important events to ever occur. As the name implies, the nature and purpose of this time’s events have been speculated upon, exaggerated, and obfuscated by countless legions of storytellers, theologians, and poets, and rare is the culture that does not have some tale to tell about the origin of the world.

Despite this, our knowledge of the Mythical Age is surprisingly complete. In addition to accounts from beings who were contemporary with this time, the first race, known to themselves as the Ne’kalsaid, were notorious note-takers, their written history not only plentiful but relatively accurate. The bulk of our knowledge of this time has been gleaned from their weave-scripts, supplemented by Yz’drad engravings that survived the Long Midnight (See Age of Strife) and that selfsame races’ chorus-annals. Unfortunately, the dominance of these two peoples’ records in the historical sphere leads many to believe the modern perception of the Mythical Age to be heavily skewed towards a Central-Northern perspective.

The ‘early’ Mythical Age is defined as the time when the Gods were at their most active, and the mortal races the least - it was divine hands that crafted the cities and societies of this time, and divine whims that brought nature into her aspect. The Avatars, the collective term for creatures born of a spark of divinity, were in their infancy, and aside from Ramtha the Midnight Sorceress, they were primal beings born of powerful emotions, more forces of nature than agents of divine will. While the transition from the early to middle Mythical Age is far from firm, many would place it at some point betwixt the last of the primordial wastes being swept away (a feat that the Ne’kalsaid uncharacteristically attributed to Al-Arak, a god relatively unknown to them at the time) and when mortals had established dominion on all of Ardoria’s land.

While the events of the middle Mythical Age are mostly of little note, the series of unrelated conflicts across the globe that is known as the high Mythical Age, beginning with the war between the Ne’kalsaid and a [forgotten race of Avian giants](Koraki), is catalogued in gruesome detail. Among these conflicts are the previously noted Ne’kalsaid War of Survival, which brought their kind near ruination and defined the Ne’kalsaid character for Ages to come; the Alaktu-Ramthan War of Favor, in which Ramtha established her and the Yz’Drad’s position as first among Votraak’s followers; and the ‘War of Consumption’ (lit. translation Great Hunger Aggression), in which the disparate Radnii tribes united for the last time to combat an overwhelming invasion of the Agnathian precursor race (See Origins of the Aquatic Empires), and through victory establishing their kind as major players in the game of conquest, a quality that persisted in many strains of their species once divided.

## FLOURISHING AGE
*The Hearth-Times, The Second Movement, The Gentle Era*

As the fires of the late Mythical Age began to die down, a period of prosperity emerged among the victors, and it is here, at the dawn of the Flourishing Age, that civilization and culture began to take root. Possible beginnings for the Flourishing Age are placed as early as the construction of the first tribe-aligned Radnii cities (Umai being the first among them) and as late as the establishment of the First Ne’kalsaid Empire. The early Flourishing Age saw the advent of inter-special trade and cultural exchange, an effort spearheaded by the Seeker Order of the Saurganites (at the time, simply a term for Yz’Drad from Saurgaheim). New breeds of mortal emerged at a dizzying rate from wild lands, and while their exploitation or cooperation with the great powers at the time were not unheard of, much of the world had yet to be tamed as great Empires looked inwards and promoted domestic development.

The middle Flourishing Age was characterized by a peak in Arcane and Occult research, the marriage of divine inspiration and the nascent scholarly tradition leading to a period of mystical advancement unseen before or since. For many, this marked the turning point at which Ardoria passed from a playground of the divine to a garden cultivated by mortal hands.


## Period of Strife
Age of perpetual warfare brought about by Ramtha’s bid for godhood. While Ramtha’s War of Ascension was not the only conflict of the time, the epoch begins and ends with it. The Great Undoing of the First Ne’Kalsaid Empire occured 

## VALIANT AGE
Age of heroism, civilization, culture, virtue, plentitude, and a renewed interest in exploration, cooperation, and knowledge. The latter half saw the arrival of the Ungods and the beginning of the exodus of divinity from the world.

## WITHERING AGE
A long period of stagnation and degradation that was the result of the bleeding of the divine light from the world. Empires crumbled, species degenerated, knowledge became lost. What few empires remained are propped up by the Ungod’s font of divine light.



## Period of Ruination
A short age in which Ardoria finally succumbed to its fate. Lands grew fallow, fell beasts roamed the world, mass extinctions were common, and the Ungods warred amongst themselves for what scraps were left. Those that survived did so by ascending to a new form of existence, or twisting themselves in desperation into bizarre creatures capable of surviving in Ultimordia.

## ULTIMORDIAL AGE
A return to the conditions the plane existed in before the birth of Ardoria. Yet to be worn by the sands of time as the world before, ruined structures and meager survivors can be found amongst the endless stretches of ashen plains. It is said that when the Last Ungod lights the Beacons of Divinity, the attention of new divines will be drawn to the plane once more, and continue the Great Cycle by breathing light back into the dead land.
