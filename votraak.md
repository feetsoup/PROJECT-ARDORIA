Also known as He Whose Eyes Are The Night Sky and The Lantern of Exiles, Vot'raak is the Lord of the [[Sphere]] of [[Magic]] and creator of [[Ramtha]]. He is typically depicted as a mass of hoofed limbs, eyes, and antlers, or a shadowed figure bearing a stone tablet and lantern. Vot'raak is considered the first speaker of [[Blacktongue]], and as such the first practitioner of spoken language.

Vot'raak is worshipped by the dispossessed and the ambitious. Those who wish to overturn the natural order seek his volatile power. Outside of academic circles, Vot'raak worship is treated with suspicion due to his favor being granted without regards to ideals or loyalties. The idea is that, were someone motivated by higher ideals, they would be utilizing the more predictable powers of the other gods. To the ignorant, Vot'raak is a god of chaos and destruction, of death and cold.

Learned [[Academician]]s have formed a slightly more accurate hypothesis. Under their understanding, Vot'raak is a functionary above all else, endlessly occupied with the logistics of spellwork and Sorcery. His power is associated with amorality because he is simply too alien to care for morality. While the steps required are complicated and obscure, anyone who speaks the words and performs the rituals can work Sorcery, for better or worse.
