As a potter forms their crafts from clay, the Sindhe were formed from the boiling blood of the earth by their shaper, [[Ba-Tu-Hir]] (Hands of Flame). They stand tall with their prideful machinations and extreme arrogance, as they see themselves as tasked with shaping the world around them into their own vision. Natural born crafters, the Sindhe seem to share an unnatural beauty with their arts. Their bodies will take in materials over the span of a Sindhe’s life, eventually changing the tinge of their normally gray skin.

HISTORY

The deity [[Ba-Tu-Hir]] is the god of the flame and earth, who labored, dissatisfied, for untold eons to create true beauty. He had created works both terrifying and awesome, crafts that evoked feelings of inspiration, sadness, and anger, but always destroyed them upon creation, as they did not satisfy him. He continued this cycle until he noticed that the world was not still in the darkness, as it always was. When he looked upon the source and saw the first living creatures, Ba-Tu-Hir found himself enamored. For some time he watched the first animals crawl in the mud, and knew that he could make something that surpassed all that had come before. Beneath the surface of the earth, he set to work crafting his mind’s image. With careful hands, he created the first Sindhe. When he gazed upon what he had wrought, he knew that he had created something that extended beyond his simple crafts, and had created true art, for which its derived meaning and purpose changed through its own will. Ba-Tu-Hir was not yet satisfied, but spared the Sindhe destruction, as they had the capacity to make their own creations.

They would instead work in the workshops under the Great Mount the Fire-Smith claimed as hearth, Fest. There they kept the industry working in service of their God until the Craftsman brought forth the [[Automatons]].

Tensions arose between the Sindhe and the Kuthek - a caste of Sindhe given control over the Automatons - that eventually led to the exile of the Ash Fae from below [[Mount Fest]]. They fled through the Black Entrance of the forge and soon founded Narsis. Their first Hir (Flame) [[Womac]] rose to power during this tumultuous time. Hir-Womac was a master craftsman, and great leader of the people, truly blessed by Ba-tu-Hir and an Avatar of his will.

As time passed, the world became rife with threats to the Sindhe, Womac ordered the first excursions into the forges. By re-infiltrating abandoned workshops, Womac and others brought Great Crafts to their people. The most notable of which is the art of [[Ensorcelling]], or imbuing and object with magical properties.

BLESSING(S)

Shaped by Ba-Tu-Hir: Sindhe bodies are strikingly beautiful as a result of being shaped beneath the earth. Their bodies also have a fey immunity to heat, allowing them to manipulate extremely hot materials with ease. Their grey skin will take in trace materials throughout the life of the Sindhe, slightly changing color over time. The efficient design also allows them to live longer lives, sometimes reaching 200 years before death.

CURSES

Arrogance of Beauty: The Sindhe are the greatest creations of Ba-Tu-Hir, and believe that they are to be treated as such. They disdain the creations of others, especially those they brand abomination. They are also known to judge their own by standards of quality that some may see as only surface level.
Anger of the Flame: The Sindhe are a fiery race from a fiery land, and are hot-tempered as a result. Their anger is such that is terrifying to behold for any that it is directed toward.

GIFTS

The Ashlands: A home for the Sindhe, the Ashlands around the fiery mountain Feswer are lands both stunning harshness and fertile plains. The pools of heated earth help the Sindhe with their crafts, as do the valuable materials throughout.

Hands of Ba-Tu-Hir: The Sindhe incorporate some small magic into their crafts, able to create more effective crafts, such as their glass.
