# Rimevoid
#place

The freezing wastes that served as the cradle of [[Ramtha]] and the early peoples of the [[Dradi]] race. Only the hardiest of life survives on the surface of the Rimevoid; the rest spend the majority of their days in the network of twisting passages and chambers below.

The bones of desolated cities and fortresses lie just beneath the rime, leviathans of stone from [[Before]]. Despite centuries of exploration and inhabitation, it is believed only a fraction of these structures are known to modern people. Logic-defying monsters and the degenerate remnant of the [[Antediluvians]] stalk the halls, eager to feed on those that come seeking the legendary riches of the Rimebound Palaces.
