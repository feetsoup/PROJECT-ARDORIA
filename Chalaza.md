A miragelike tower of incomprehensible height deep in the [[Rimevoid]]. Ostensibly built by [[Ramtha]] and home to [[The Gilded Ring]].
Sits on a [[Leyline]], said to be a bridge to the [[Supernal Realm]].

Variations:
 - The tower is all that remains of the vessel that brought the [[Antediluvians]] to Ardoria. The Gilded Ring closely guard this secret, and plan to restore the vessel in case the worst should come to pass.
