The material world is composed of refractions of [[Divine Light]]. This Light shines through a higher dimension known as the supernal world, where it is reflected through bubble-like spheres and translated into substance. There are many spheres encompassing all organizations of existence - Life, Land, and Wind are examples of easily grasped concepts. More esoteric things, like Destruction, Growth, and Joy are also given form in a way beings of the lower planes struggle to grasp.

Major spheres refract divine light; minor spheres refract light directed at them by the major spheres. For instance, Life feeds smaller domains, such as Flora, or Spiders. Because of this, there is some redundancy in the domains spheres dictate.

The inhabitants of the supernal realm exist within these spheres - these beings are known as [[Gods]]. When a single god rules a sphere, he is known as a Lord. When many gods control a sphere, they are known as Lordlings. Gods are sustained by the process of converting Light into substance. More accurately, substance is the byproduct of the consumption of Divine Light.

Gods struggle - both within and between spheres - for a greater share of the Light. The effects of these struggles are felt in the lower realm. For instance, when Destruction is ascendant, war and chaos reign. When Flora is choked of itsâ€™ share, flowers wilt as entire swathes of forests wither and die. Paradoxically, the opposite relationship can be observed - The flourishing of Love in the material plane can cause the sphere of Love to do the same. Knowing how this is possible requires an understanding of reality that mortals can only attain in the depths of madness.

A vanishingly small amount of Divine Light escapes the notice of the gods and capture of the spheres, instead shining directly into the material world. How this affects the lower realm is not known. Some say it is the prime substance that makes miracles possible, others, the material from which souls are wrought. Others say it is Truth, which enlightens man just as often as it twists their brains into structures of unsettling alienage. All or none of these may be true.

The societies of the material world may hold beliefs about the higher realms that are distortions or outright contradictions of this interpretation. Such contrivances are expected and even useful, as too close an understanding to the workings of the supernal realm unsettles the mind. One thing is true: this conception of the cosmos has been reached independently many times throughout history with just as many means.

## Demons
*Credit to Hunter*

Demons can be summarized as gods that use their force of will to cling to divine light in order to exist in the physical world, as well as the supernal. This act is mostly seen as an affront to divine light, due to the nature of its interactions. In the supernal realm, the bubbles provide separation and order, while the physical world provides mingling of concepts. That is the precise reason why a demon exists. They crave the unfiltered divine light, but have gained a taste for physicality.

As for their methods, the way they exist in the physical world widely varies. Some take form by means of manipulation, while others opt to manifest a physical form. Though, They all have the common similarity of existing both in the supernal realm and the physical realm at the same time. This requires them to constantly feed on a supply of divine light to exist physically. Breaking down substance into a sort of proto-light is especially helpful in that process. This is easiest to do in more esoteric substances, such as emotion.

One of the first demons was a corrupted god of reflections/refractions , that was forced into demonship by the very nature of reflections. They discovered the act of duality when their form was reflected into the physical realm, and physical beings reflected into the supernal realm. and they found they could easily "tie" themselves to the physical realm,  When other gods observed this, stringent restrictions were enforced on the reflection region, and reflections were divided into many forms (mirrors, lenses, etc.) And strictly watched for any unconventional interactions between the two realms.
